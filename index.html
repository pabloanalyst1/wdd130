        <p>Hi there! My name is Jose Arizandieta, I'm from Guatemala, I enjoy listening to music, dancing and playing videogames, I live with my parents and I have 2 brothers and 1 dog. I am interested on learning about programming and in a future to specialize in Data Analytics, I have completed 2 Google Data Analytics certificates, I want to get the necessary skills to get a better job where I can provide for my family. I think this is the correct path, as I want to think and analize things.
